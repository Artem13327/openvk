# Rating bar behaviour
# If rating overflows 100 older versions of OpenVK
# used to render a full bar, but original VK used to
# treat last two digits of rating as % of bar fullness.
# 
# Example:
# Rating 20 - Old OVK: 20%, VK: 20%
# Rating 100 - Old OVK: 100%, VK: 100%
# Rating 1983 - Old OVK: 100%, VK: 83%
# 
# Possible values:
# + Set this option to 1 if you want to use quirky OpenVK behaviour
# + Set this option to 0 if you want to use the canonical VK behaviour
profile.rating-bar-behaviour: 0

# Blob deletion behaviour
# Current VK and old OpenVK don't delete files automatically,
# thus leaving ability to access user-deleted medias by direct URL.
# This config option allows to change this.
# 
# Possible values:
# + Set this option to 2 if you want to delete files upon user-initiated deletion
#  (this option will prohibit restoring any deleted media)
# + Set this option to 1 if you want to delete files once they're removed from DB completely
#  (this option most likely won't have any meaningful effect, please use option 2)
# + Set this option to 0 if you want to use quirky VK and OpenVK behaviour
blobs.erase-upon-deletion: 0

# Allow graffiti in comments?
# VK used to provide ability to post graffitis in comments, but only via
# mobile client.
# 
# Possible values:
# + Set this option to 1 if you want to use quirky VK Mobile behaviour (yes graffiti in comments)
# + Set this option to 0 if you want to use VK Desktop behaviour (no graffiti in comments)
