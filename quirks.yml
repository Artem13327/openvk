# Rating bar behaviour
# If rating overflows 100 older versions of OpenVK
# used to render a full bar, but original VK used to
# treat last two digits of rating as % of bar fullness.
# 
# Example:
# Rating 20 - Old OVK: 20%, VK: 20%
# Rating 100 - Old OVK: 100%, VK: 100%
# Rating 1983 - Old OVK: 100%, VK: 83%
# 
# Possible values:
# + Set this option to 1 if you want to use quirky OpenVK behaviour
# + Set this option to 0 if you want to use the canonical VK behaviour
